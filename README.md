# Push-Button-Counter-
This project uses an Arduino to create a push button counter with a temperature sensor and LCD display. Each button press increments a counter, and both the count and real-time temperature (from an LM35 sensor) are shown on the LCD. It demonstrates digital input, analog sensing, and output display in embedded systems.

üß∞ Components Used:
Arduino Uno
Push Button
10kŒ© Resistor (pull-down)
16x2 LCD display (or Serial Monitor)
Breadboard
Jumper wires
(Optional) Temperature sensor to display additional data

‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle:
The push button is connected to a digital input pin of the Arduino.
A pull-down resistor ensures the input reads LOW when the button is not pressed.
On each button press, the Arduino detects a HIGH signal and increments a counter variable.
The current counter value is displayed on the LCD.
(Optional) A temperature sensor like LM35 can be added to show real-time temperature alongside the counter.

üí° Applications:
People counters at doors
Event clickers
Industrial part counters
Entry-level learning project for digital input/output and debouncing
