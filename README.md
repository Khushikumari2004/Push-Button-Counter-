# Push-Button-Counter-
This project uses an Arduino to create a push button counter with a temperature sensor and LCD display. Each button press increments a counter, and both the count and real-time temperature (from an LM35 sensor) are shown on the LCD. It demonstrates digital input, analog sensing, and output display in embedded systems.


# ðŸ§° Components Used:-
Arduino Uno
Push Button
10kÎ© Resistor (pull-down)
16x2 LCD display (or Serial Monitor)
Breadboard
Jumper wires
(Optional) Temperature sensor to display additional data
